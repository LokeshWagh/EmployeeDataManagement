* **Frontend:**
    * **React:** For building a fast, component-based user interface.
    * **React Router:** For seamless client-side routing and navigation.
    * **Axios:** For making robust, promise-based HTTP requests to the backend API.
    * **Tailwind CSS:** For modern, utility-first styling.
    * **Formik and Yup:** Used for creating the form and Adding the validation in the form.
